"""Verify candidate selectors against the live DOM via a Node/Playwright helper.

The helper is generated as a temporary ``.mjs`` and run with ``node`` as a subprocess —
the same "shell out to the installed Playwright" pattern the Test Runner uses, so no new
Python browser dependency is introduced. It loads the app URL and reports how many elements
each candidate selector resolves to; the caller treats "exactly one" as verified.
